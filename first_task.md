# Create the file for the first task

I need several commits here and couple tags probably.

## Wow, a lot have chnaged since I worked with tags

A lot have changed since I worked with tags last time - there are annotated tags now!
Or i just forgot that they where there )))
As usual, the best source to get info about git is:
[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

Actually that's amazing - created the branches pushed them to github(developmen, feature)
Quite happy that I'm playing with that and thinking about how to actually add a bit more
scripts probably to my bashrc.
